# Python Documentation

Keep it simple, like if 12 year old reads this document he/she will be able to understand.

## Naming Convenience
Recommended [naming convenience](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) for defining a _function_, _modules (files)_, and _variables_ are use all **lower_cases** maybe use underscore for readability, for _class_ are **UpperCamelCase**, and for _packages_ are **lowercases** although the use of underscores is discouraged.

## Classes

Some Noted about classes:

Class is a logical grouping of data and methods. Instance of a class is called objects. Data and methods are called class attributes. Class functions are called methods.

```python    
name = 'Aravind'

name - object name
'Aravind' - object of string class
```

## Data Structures

#### 1. Stack ✓
   
Based on Last In, First Out (LIFO) arrangement, new elements are inserted at top of the stack one at the time and user can delete the top element of the stack one at time.

#### 2. Queue ✓

Based on First In, First Out (FIFO) arrangement, new element are insert at rear/ last and user can 

#### 3. Linked List ✓
#### 4. Doubly Linked List ✓
#### 5. Circular Linked List
