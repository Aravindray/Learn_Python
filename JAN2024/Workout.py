# string1 = "Beautiful, beautiful, the world is so, With skies of blue and fields aglow. The sun that shines, the stars that twinkle, The moon that glows, the rivers that trickle. Beautiful, beautiful, the world is grand, With mountains high and oceans so grand. The forests green, the flowers so bright, The birds that sing, the stars at night. Beautiful, beautiful, the world is vast, With deserts hot and glaciers so vast. The canyons deep, the valleys so wide, The creatures that roam, the oceans that hide. Beautiful, beautiful, the world is true, With people kind and hearts so true. The love that's shared, the joy that's found, The peace that's felt, the world goes round."
